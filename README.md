# Back-end NoSQL in the cloud

Im just returning my React folder and I put the server.js that connects to the database in this folder (under src) so there is no static website. You can see in app.js and test.js that Im connecting to the database.

# What is NoSQL database?

NoSQL is a term for non-relational databases. In other words they store data in a format other then relational tables.  
There are four major types of NoSQL databases:

- Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
- Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
- Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
- Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.

# What is the difference between a NoSQL and SQL database?

SQL are relational, meaning the data is organized in tables. Often the data within these tables have relationship with one another.  
NoSQL is non-relational. Meaning, it is docoment-oriented. All of its data is stored in a more laundry list order.

SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
